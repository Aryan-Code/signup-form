# signup-form

This is a signup and login form build using HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and API.

To use the project first upload the file "database_file.sql" in database using the same name i.e. database_file which in my case was localhost/phpmyadmin.
After that start the server which in my case was xampp and then start the project using the localhost server.


In the sign up form information such as Name , phonenumber , username, password and photo are asked by the user. 
However the photo file does not get saved in the database because it was causing errors.

After signing up the form , the user can login using the sign in section.
